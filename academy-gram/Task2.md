### Challenge Advancements

We need to improve the challenge and I have some ideas I want implemented.

We need a nice checker.py which will run on our server and interact with our challenge or service on player vulnboxes in our Attack Defence CTF. Now these are some examples of checkers:

https://ctf-gameserver.org/checkers/
https://ctf-gameserver.org/checkers/python-library/

Example checker:
https://github.com/X3eRo0/academy-ctf-challenges/raw/refs/heads/master/cowsay/checker.py

Now look at the above example and implement the flag placement which would be done by checker as admin account. 

I also want the checker to handle the bot activity.

I was thinking we can have bots pull random pictures like this script of mine does with my API:

```
import requests, random, os

API_KEY = "51875202-47194d033d9270a5a93b607a6"
query = "great"
save_path = "random_flower.jpg"

# Pick a random page within Pixabay's 500 max results
page = random.randint(1, 25)  # 20 per page Ã— 25 pages = 500

url = f"https://pixabay.com/api/?key={API_KEY}&q={query}&image_type=photo&per_page=20&page={page}"
resp = requests.get(url)
resp.raise_for_status()
data = resp.json()

if data.get("hits"):
    choice = random.choice(data["hits"])
    img_url = choice.get("largeImageURL") or choice.get("webformatURL")
    print("Downloading:", img_url)

    img_data = requests.get(img_url).content
    with open(save_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(img_data)

    print(f"Saved as {save_path}")
else:
    print("No images found.")

```
You can use the same API key and code and post the images through accounts.

I want to write the best checker as its defined in the links above.
